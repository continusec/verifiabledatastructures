**This implementation is for early stage use, feedback and bug reports welcome!**

This repository contains a client, server, and embeddable library implementation of the Continusec Verifiable Data Structures API.

It was written by Adam Eijdenberg (<adam@continusec.com>) and is released under the Apache 2.0 License.

Please see the godoc for information on how to use the libraries: <https://godoc.org/github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures>

See the [HTTP REST API doc](./doc/REST-API.md), for examples using the REST API.

# Quickstart

```bash
make
```

```bash
./target/vdbserver
```

# Development Commands

The following commands are useful for those working with the source.

## Re-generate proto and asset files

```bash
go generate
```

(will need `go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/... github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go`)

## Rebuild server

```bash
go install github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures/cmd/vdbserver
```

## Run tests

```bash
make test
```

## Sample config file for server

```proto
# openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout vds-key.pem -out vds-cert.pem -days 3600 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost' -batch
# server_cert_path: "vds-cert.pem"
# server_key_path: "vds-key.pem"
