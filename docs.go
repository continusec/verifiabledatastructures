Package verifiabledatastructures provides append-only, verifiable logs and maps. Both a client, server and
embedded options are provided, along with various data storage methods.

This is an early release of the open-source offering, and APIs are subject to change.
If you are using this library, please drop us a note at support@continusec.com so that we
can work with you on any API changes.

To interact with logs and maps, you will first need to get a reference to the low-level
API which is the set of functions defined in pb.VerifiableDataStructuresServiceServer.

Running as embedded instance

Run your own embedded instance:

	// Create an in-memory, non-persistent database, suitable for tests
	db := &memory.TransientStorage{}

	// Create a service object with no permission checking, and synchronous mutations
	service := (&verifiable.Service{
		AccessPolicy: policy.Open,
		Mutator:      &instant.Mutator{Writer: db},
		Reader:       db,
	}).MustCreate()

Connecting to a server

Connect to a remote server (example below uses grpc.Client, see also httprest.Client):

	// Connect to remote GRPC server
	service := (&grpc.Client{
		Address: "verifiabledatastructures.example.com:8081",
	}).MustDial()

Running your own server

To run your own server, simply take a pb.VerifiableDataStructuresServiceServer as created
by verifiable.Service above, and expose like follows:

	grpc.StartServer(&pb.ServerConfig{
		InsecureServerForTesting: true,
		GrpcListenBind:           ":8081",
		GrpcListenProtocol:       "tcp4",
	}, service)

Using the service

Once you have a service object, whether it is local or remote, we recommend that you wrap
it using the higher level Client object:

	client := &verifiable.Client{
		Service: service,
	}

Note that currently accounts, logs and maps are all created lazily, there is no need to
explicitly create these.

To add entries into a log (ctx can be any valid context, e.g. context.TODO() if unsure):

	promise, err := client.Account("0", "").VerifiableLog().Add(ctx, &pb.LeafData{
		LeafInput: []byte("foo"),
	})

See the documentation for verifiable.Log and verifiable.Map for all operations.

Other storage mechanisms

bolt.Storage:

	// Save logs and maps to data directory using embedded boltdb database
	db := &bolt.Storage{
		Path: "/path/to/database/dir","
	}
	defer db.Close() // Releases file locks

	// pass to LocalService in the same manner as above, e.g.
	service := (&verifiable.Service{
		AccessPolicy: policy.Open,
		Mutator:      &instant.Mutator{Writer: db},
		Reader:       db,
	}).MustCreate()

Other mutation mechanisms

batch.Mutator:

	// performs mutations asynchronously in batches - experimental
	service := (&verifiable.Service{
		AccessPolicy: policy.Open,
		Mutator: (&batch.Mutator{
			Writer:     db,
			BatchSize:  1000,
			BufferSize: 100000,
			Timeout:    time.Millisecond * 10,
		}).MustCreate(),
		Reader:       db,
	}).MustCreate()

Other authorization policies

policy.Static:

	// actually does permission checks, based on static config, e.g.
	service := (&verifiable.Service{
		Mutator:      &instant.Mutator{Writer: db},
		Reader:       db,
		AccessPolicy: &policy.Static{
			Policy: []*pb.ResourceAccount{
				{
					Id: "0",
					Policy: []*pb.AccessPolicy{
						{
							NameMatch:     "foo",
							Permissions:   []pb.Permission{pb.Permission_PERM_ALL_PERMISSIONS},
							ApiKey:        "secret",
							AllowedFields: []string{"*"},
						},
						{
							NameMatch:     "f*",
							Permissions:   []pb.Permission{pb.Permission_PERM_LOG_READ_ENTRY},
							ApiKey:        "*",
							AllowedFields: []string{"name"},
						},
					},
				},
			},
		},
	}).MustCreate()

Each of the above is interchangeable with others that implement the correct interface.

Examples

Here is a full example of using verifiabledatastructures as an embedded storage layer in your application:

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"log"

		"github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures/mutator/instant"
		"github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures/oracle/policy"
		"github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures/pb"
		"github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures/storage/bolt"
		"github.com/continusec/verifiabledatastructures/verifiable"
		"google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
	)

	func main() {
		// Create a pointer to a data storage layer, here we persist to disk using Bolt
		db := &bolt.Storage{
			Path: "/path/to/directory/to/store/data",
		}
		defer db.Close() // Releases file locks

		// Create an instance of the service
		service := (&verifiable.Service{
			// Allow access to everything
			AccessPolicy: policy.Open,

			// Read data from our database
			Reader: db,

			// Apply mutations synchronously
			Mutator: &instant.Mutator{
				Writer: db,
			},
		}).MustCreate()

		// Create a client to directly call the service, no need to stand up a server
		client := &verifiable.Client{
			Service: service,
		}

		// Get a pointer to a log
		vlog := client.Account("0", "").VerifiableLog("foo")

		// Create a context (not currently used)
		ctx := context.Background()

		// Add something to it
		_, err := vlog.Add(ctx, &pb.LeafData{
			LeafInput: []byte("bar"),
		})
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		// Print tree head
		th, err := vlog.TreeHead(ctx, verifiable.Head)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		log.Println(proto.CompactTextString(th))
	}
